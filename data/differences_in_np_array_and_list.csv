Data Types,Can contain homogenous data only, Can contain data of variety of types
Memory Efficiency, Higher, Lower
Speed, Much faster due to optimized C backend, Slower for large numerical operations
Functionability, Rich numerical  and matrix operations
Element Access, Faster due to direct memory access, Slower due to indirect referencing
Broadcasting, Supported, Not supported
Shape, Supports multi-dimensional arrays, 1D by default and nested for more
Vectorized Ops, Supports element-wise operation directly, Requires loops
